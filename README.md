## Project Structure

This project contains the following pages:

- The **homepage** is the first page you see, where you can search for recipes using the search bar. There are also buttons to help you find a random recipe. Below the search area, you'll find various recipe recommendations that you can click on to view specific recipes.

- The **recipe page** is organized into categories like "breakfast," "lunch," "dinner," and "snack." You can choose a category to see the available recipes. When you click on a specific recipe, it takes you to its detailed page.
